This Lib is for getting pulse count values from a slave I2C device.
Based on ChatGPT-3 code

SlaveDataI2C Class:

SlaveDataI2C.h declares the SlaveDataI2C class with methods to initialize and request pulse data.
SlaveDataI2C.cpp implements the methods. The requestPulseData method sends a request to the I2C slave and reads the response.
Example Sketch:

The example sketch shows how to use the SlaveDataI2C library to request pulse data from the I2C slave and print it to the Serial Monitor.
Wire Library:

The Wire library is used for I2C communication.
Data Handling:

The requestPulseData method reads 4 bytes from the slave and combines them into two 16-bit integers representing the pulse counts.
